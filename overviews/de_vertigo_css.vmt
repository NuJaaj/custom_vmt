Material proxies code to change the frame of the radar. 

Idea: Set max height coordinates to $pos_max_y, player position will be clamped, divided and turned into a intenger value so used to set texture frame. 

The value of player position is get in PlayerPosition, stored at $pos, $pos[2] are clamped, stored at $pos_rsv and this custom var is divided by $pos_max_y. After this turned into a intenger, and if the result its less from defined, the value is a float < 1 ( 0.83... ), if higher will be = or > 1 ( 1.25 etc... ) both values will turn into a int number, so or 1 or 0 on my teorical. And this is used to set the frame of animated texture in Int proxie ( resultVar "$frame" ).

Lower frame 0, higher 1. 

VMT Code:

UnlitGeneric
{
	$basetexture	"pain"
	$vertexalpha	"1"
	$no_fullbright	"1"	
	$translucent	"1"
	$ignorez		"1"
    
	$pos			"[0 0 0]"
	$pos_rsv		".0"	
	$pos_solved		"0"	// Used to store the divided value
	$pos_max_y		"11730" // Max height from your map
	$zeroo			"0"
	
	Proxies
	{
		PlayerPosition
		{
			scale		1
			resultVar	"$pos"
		}
		
		Clamp
		{
			srcVar1		"$zeroo"
			min			"$pos[2]"
			max			"$pos[2]"
			resultVar	"$pos_rsv"
		}
		
		Divide
		{
			srcVar1		"$pos_rsv"
			srcVar2		"$pos_max_y"
			resultVar	"$pos_solved"
		}
		
		Int
		{
			srcVar1		"$pos_solved"
			resultVar	"$frame"
		}
		
	}
}
